Cloud skills or agent skills.
This is something I have been waiting for a long time.
And honestly, I'm so excited
because this has a huge potential and such a game changer
just like MCP in changing
how we design airball flows or AR agents.
And not just within cloud,
other air models might likely adopt similar concepts.
So in this video, I explain what skills actually is,
why this is another game changer.
And most importantly,
how you can start using them today to get immediate results.
Let's go.
So what is cloud skills really?
The official definitions is very confusing.
The easiest way to think of it is
we usable instructions menu that teach cloud
how you want tasks to be done,
what tools to use, what standard to follow.
So it execute automatically anytime, anywhere when you need it.
Before cloud skills,
when you execute repetitive tasks like writing, marketing,
emails that follow your brain voice or process,
you will have to repeat the same instructions
in every single job.
This is inconsistent and time consuming.
Now you might be thinking,
just use a cloud project with custom instructions, right?
Yes, 100%.
And this is what most people are already doing.
But there are still two fundamental limitations.
First, these instructions are not portable.
Imagine next time when you're doing another campaign,
you either have to execute inside this project
or you repeat all the instructions again.
And second, it's not stackable.
Imagine you have a specialized project for copywriting
and other project for campaign analysis.
You can't just combine them together for a new task.
They operate in complete isolation.
And so you have to build so many different projects
which might actually end up with overlapping workflows.
And that's why the solution, cloud skills.
So instead of embedding all these workflow instructions
and resources inside a project,
you extract them out and package them
into what they call the fancy term skills
and make them available at account level,
including the web app, cloud code or cloud API.
So once you understand this,
you can have so many kinds of user manual,
perhaps an email writing menu, market research menu,
design template menu,
and they can be used all together as well.
And that is why this is a game changer.
As now you have way more flexibility
and possibility of these skills
for your workflow or agent design.
Now another big confusion is between skills, MCP and projects.
And someone might tell you skills
is just Anthropics way to fix the MCP problems.
And this is a big misconception.
If you view it under the lens of cloud ecosystem,
cloud itself is the brain.
The core intelligence that make decisions.
Skills are the instruction menu.
The reusable instructions
for how specific tasks should be done.
MCP provides the tools,
the actual capabilities to do things
outside of class knowledge,
like creating a file, calling a database.
Projects are the dedicated workspace
where you can combine skills,
MCP tools and background knowledge
for specific ongoing work.
And this is exactly what makes this cloud ecosystem
so powerful.
You can mix and match
based on what your specific workflow needs.
Not every workflow needs all these components.
They are not competing.
They are building blocks
and are designed to be coexist
to build powerful workflows or agents.
Basically there are three types of skills
you can use with cloud.
For this video demo,
I'll be using the cloud web application.
First, the official skills by Anthropics.
These are ready to use skills built right inside cloud.
Just go to settings under capabilities.
Here you will control what capabilities
cloud will use in the chat.
But first you have to make sure code execution
and file creation has been turned on
in order to use skills.
Then you will see a list of predefined skills.
I do not recommend you turn them on all at once.
Just pick the one that you're really gonna use
because more skills might confuse cloud
when executing the workflow.
Besides the official skills created by Anthropics,
there are also skills created by Anthropics partner
like Notion.
So you can check out the official GitHub repository
and scroll down to partner skills
where you can download the skills and use them on cloud.
So I will put the link in the description.
And second, custom skills.
So these are your own creation.
It can be your own workflow instructions,
resource template or even coding script.
You prepare your own skill file
according to the official format
and you activate them by uploading the skill file.
You can also turn on and use the official skill
called skill creator to create your custom skills
if you're nonsentical.
This is how you personalize cloud to your way of working.
And I will show you how in just a minute.
Third is community creator skills.
So there is also a growing ecosystem of skills
created by other cloud user.
But you want to be cautious about security
when using these community skills.
And according to Anthropics,
once you turn on the skills,
it will be automatically triggered
when it's contextually relevant.
But from my experience,
cloud might not trigger all the time as you expect.
So my tip is to also add this
to the account level custom instructions
to make sure cloud will always consider
relevant skills when responding.
And if you're a marketer wanting to build
your own cloud skills,
there is a resource that pairs perfectly
with what will be covered in this video.
Cloud has four marketers from the hustle.
You can find the download link below.
It is a comprehensive prompt library
decided specifically for marketing power users like us.
It has 10 course sections
covering every common marketing task
we're all familiar with.
Content creation, business research,
dashboard creation.
Particularly, I like the strategic analysis
and thinking section.
I believe that AI shouldn't just give you direct answers.
It can be your great thinking partner
that can challenge your own assumptions
on covering your blind spots.
And here is the best part.
You can integrate these prompts directly
into your custom clock skills
as you build all your marketing workflows.
So you are not building everything from scratch.

It's made by the hustle who is sponsoring this video.
Thank you so much.
All right, now let's try a simple example
using the official theme factory skills we just turned on.
So let's say I'm building a landing page
for a new SaaS product called Powstrack.
And I already got the copy.
Now just attach the copy to cloud
and then I'll set to build the landing page mockup
using a beautiful theme.
Note, I haven't mentioned using any specific skills,
but you can see cloud is now checking
the theme factory skills automatically
to pick a beautiful theme.
And that is because the account level
custom instructions I have already set.
So within just a minute, the landing page is ready.
The official theme factories has 10 theme
and cloud picked the tech innovation theme from the library.
It looks pretty cool and tech savvy.
So with this simple skills,
you can quickly apply ready to use styling
to any documents that you create
like a landing page or a presentation.
Let's try another example.
So this time I'll set to drop an FAQ work document
about these product launch,
which will be shared with the internal team.
So this time cloud is reading
the building document creation skills
and generating these well-formatted documents.
So these looks pretty decent and comprehensive
with seven pages.
And you can see cloud applied the same theme
to this document as well.
The only complaint I have is it didn't use
the internal communication skills
that I expect for driving these FAQ response.
So this is the limitation of cloud skills
that it highly relies on a context
to trigger the relevant skills
or you need to specify the skills explicitly in a chat.
And what I like is now I can just either download the document
or I can upload to my Google Drive,
making it more easy to share with the team.
So using the official theme factories
or any other building skills that you turn on,
you can already quickly apply that into your workflow
by giving relevant context.
Now you know how to use an existing building skills,
but you can also create a new custom skills
in case there's no one that match your needs
and there are three main ways to create a new custom skills.
The first way is to extend an existing official skills
and we package it into a new skill.
For example, I run a flower business
and my company has this branded presentation template
and I want cloud to use it
whenever building a presentation deck.
Now just attach this presentation template
and I'll say to first read the official PowerPoint
building skills and then create a new skills
called branded deck that extends it.
Now I highly suggest you give more context to cloud
whenever creating a new skills.
So when the skills should be triggered,
any usage example, any specific guidelines
and most importantly, I'll say to reference
to parent skills to avoid duplication
and also use the official skills creator
to ensure the proper formatting.
Then I'll put it as a ready to use SIP file.
So now cloud is reading the parent skills
and the skill creator to understand the structure
and also my uploaded template
to extract the relevant colors and fonts.
And then the new skills is ready,
is in a SIP file format and then we can just download it.
So to activate these new custom skills,
just go back to settings under capabilities
and here you can upload the new skills we just created.
And now this new skills is ready to use everywhere in the chat.
So for example, I'm building the Q3
business performance review presentation.
So first, upload the sales data
and the marketing research report
and ask cloud to extract key insights from these resources.
And just within a few minutes,
we have this comprehensive executive brief
about the performance analysis.
This is really called strength
to provide this kind of strategic insight
with summary tables.
And now we are ready to build a deck.
So ask cloud to base on these executive brief insights,
create a company branded presentation deck.
Note, I have emphasized the keyword company brand
to make sure cloud will use the branded deck skills
we just create.
So it is now triggering the brand deck skills
and understand the brand guidelines
and presentation requirements.
And then also reading
the official PowerPoint presentation skills.
And so it is now creating the presentation
and within just a few minutes,
the brand presentations is ready.
It looks pretty good with all the theme of slides
and we can just download it for double checking.
So cloud does most of them right.
The theme and style look exactly the same
as the company presentation template.
Although there's still some minor margin or layer issues
that I have to adjust myself,
for most of the content is correct
and fits them well within the layout.
A complaint is that it was not using any charts in the deck
as I instructed, but just the table only.
And whenever you find any issues
when executing the theme or you want to enhance it,
you can always give it back to cloud
and adjust the skills and update for you.
Although it's not like 100% finalized,
to be honest, I'm still impressed
because this is a complicated theme with images
and heavy styling.
And compared with other air models,
cloud is by far the only AI really able
to build beautiful presentation like this
within one single workflow.
And I would say this is the most immediate,
easiest quick win for every marketers
or working professionals.
And this method doesn't just work for presentations.
It works for documents, access brushes,
landing pages, it's completely scalable.
And so you get the idea.
You don't need to start from scratch in creating new skills.
Try to leverage any existing official skills first
and build upon it.
Now the second way is to turn any existing workflow
that you are already using and package it into new skills.
And this is another immediate quick win.
For example, I have this custom cloud project
about team reporting.
So these projects specialize in pulling the project
checker status from the Notion database
and building a custom dashboard.
So it already has a very detailed project
custom instructions, like the role,
the tool that it should be using,
workflow details, output format,
and also the output template and the resource.
So this is a really good scenarios
in packaging it as a new skill.
So first, make sure you already turn on Notion MCP,
then use this prompt to ask it
to create a new skills called Notion Project dashboard.
Very important is to ask it first study
the available Notion MCP tools
and determine which tools are really needed
for this specific workflow.
So the reason is because usually for an MCP server,
it might contain so many different tools
and you don't want the skills
to load every possible tools which might not be needed.
Then again, include all those important contacts
about these new skills
and then paste back the full set of custom instructions
with workflow details
and then upload the output template file as well.
So immediately the new skills is created
and ready to be uploaded and activate.
So the magic here is then I can now just ask cloud
to generate the project standard dashboard
from Notion in any new chat.
And I don't need to stick with any project.
Cloud will now call the Notion MCP server
and triggered Notion Project dashboard skills
for this task.
And the dashboard format styling look exactly the same
as I generated within this project.
And that means now using cloud skills,
you can make any of your established workflow possible
and combining with MCP,
you can bring them anywhere as you chat with cloud.
Now let's go more advanced
and take a step even further.
So that is the third way,
create multiple new skills from scratch
and use them and MCP all together within a cloud project.
So for example, I want to streamline my workflow
of blog content creation
from keyword research
to the actual blog content creation.
So first let's build a new skills called keyword research
that will be using the ASTRAF's MCP
and ask it to study the available ASTRAF MCP tools
as there's so many.
So give it all the context
and this time also include the workflow details.
And this is important
because we need to teach cloud
to understand the process and to follow through.
Of course, this has been simplified for the demo purpose.
I highly suggest you attach a more comprehensive versions
to ensure the skills quality.
And within a minute,
we got this new keyword research skill.
Then the second skills is the blog writer skill.
So this time,
besides including the workflow details in the prime
also include the output guideline
as I want to make sure every generated blog articles
is optimized for AR search engines.
Now let's say we have this brand project
for the like has carry coaching platform product.
It already has the product overview file,
product materials,
also with the custom instructions
that briefly covered the brand voice,
target audience,
not here I have include skills workflow.
And saying for SEO content and blog writing content,
it will use the skills keyword research and blog writer.
The tip is you don't need to include the workflow details.
Just instruct the skills it should be using for what task.
Another tip is you can also add the tools
in the custom instructions to make sure cloud knows
which tools it can use for this project.
So let's say we want to create a new blog post
about how to build a personal brand on LinkedIn
as part of the campaign launch.
So the prom is very brief
and you can see cloud is now calling the blog writing skills
and keyword research skills
that triggered the Ahrefs MCP tool
to get the relevant keyword and question data.
And even doing the web searching
as this is what I have instructed
in the blog writing workflow.
And cloud is following all the workflow details
and finally generate this formatted work document.
I am quite impressed.
It's very comprehensive with six pages
and it's exactly the format that I want.
With the too long don't reach sections for AI,
use of the question as the heading
and then use of bullet points.
And I can even upload to Google Drive
for further adjustment.
And this is just a simplified version.
Cloud can also add internal links, external links
and even images to these blog content.
And you can always just ask cloud to make changes for you.
So when do you really need the skills
or need to create a new custom skills?
Answer yourself these three core questions.
First, do you need to repeat the same instructions
across different tasks like three times or more?
Second, if putting it in a real world situation,
would you need to train a real human
about this process or standard?
Third, if quality or format consistency
is needed every time.
If you have more than two boxes checked,
the better you should create a skills.
Also, if you're on the Pope line,
the weekly usage limit can be quite a pain.
Only create custom skills for your most repeated workflows
to avoid burning tokens
or use other AI models to create a skills for you.
You can simply upload the official skill
creator CIFIAL to check GBT.
Ask it to study it and generate a new skill
by including your requirements.
This works 100%.
And skills are static and might need maintenance,
especially when it needs to call an MCP tool function,
which might change over time.
So you can ask cloud to include what I call a backup plan
whenever tool call fails
and try not to use too many MCP tools in one skill.
Keep it simple.
So make sure you try all this method I mentioned
and let me know how it goes in the comment.
And give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed this video so far.
Also, I encourage you to join my committee.
Every month we have specialized deep dive workshop
and you will also unlock all the prime resources
I share on this channel.
I hope to see you there.
And before you go,
also watch this video about MCPs.
So you have better understanding
of how these two will work together.
I'll see you next time.
