If you're a fan of Claude, you're likely only using a fraction of its power.
In fact, based on people I talk to, like 99% of people don't know how powerful it actually is.
If you're only using it as a simple chatbot, for example, you're really missing a huge opportunity with Claude's capabilities.
So in this video, I'm going to show you some powerful features of Claude that 99% of people don't even know about,
and some mind-blowing use cases so you can get the most out of Claude for your business.
By the way, if you're new here, my name is Rick Mulrady, and for the past 11 and a half years,
I've run a multi-seven-figure online business helping other online business owners grow and scale their online business more efficiently.
And for the past year and a half, I've run a community called the AI Playbook where I help other online business owners leverage AI
so that you can streamline your business and become more efficient and profitable in the process.
I'll link to the community in the description below.
Now, firstly, with Claude, you've got three options for using it.
You've got the online version, which you can see right here, just Claude.ai.
Then you've got the desktop version.
And then you've got Anthropic Console, which is where you access the Anthropic API.
So console.anthropic.com, I'll link to it in the description below.
But this is sort of equivalent to the OpenAI Playground.
But again, you get to access the API.
Now, one thing I'm always using the console for is this Generator Prompt.
So what you can do is you could put a prompt in here and then it will improve it based on the best practices of prompting Claude.
And so you can say this prompt will be used with models that have thinking enabled, so I can choose that.
I can click on Generate and it will think for a second and then it will spit out this Claude Optimized Prompt.
Again, using XML tags and so forth.
You can either continue using this prompt and executing this prompt right here from within the console
or what I often do is I'll just copy this and I'll paste it into Claude and I'll execute the prompt from there.
And within Claude, you've got essentially four core features.
You've got Chat, you've got Projects, you've got Artifacts and you have Claude Code.
I had Claude Code right here like last week for some reason it disappeared.
But you can go down to Settings, go down to Claude Code and you'll see it right here.
Then you can click on the Install Instructions link right here.
And then also hitting Under Settings, you can turn on some additional features like this is where you turn on Artifacts.
So you click on Features here, you turn on Artifacts here.
You can create AI-powered Artifacts, just turn that on.
That's where you can create apps and prototypes and interactive documents that use Claude inside the Artifacts.
I'm going to show you an example of that here today in this video.
You can also turn on the Analysis Tools.
So basically Claude can write and run code to process data, run analysis.
So this is your analytical piece of Claude for spreadsheets and so forth.
Then you've got Connectors, which I think is the most powerful along with Claude Code, the most powerful feature of Claude.
This is where you're able to connect Claude to other third-party tools like Google Drive, Gmail, Zapier, Notion, etc.
So essentially you can come down here to click on Browse Connectors and these are the pre-made connections or MCP connections.
And in the web version, they have two different options you can choose from.
The web version, these are all the tools that you can connect to in the web version.
Then you've got the desktop extensions, which I'll show you in the use cases that I've got coming up for you.
But you can see Asana, Canva, Box, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, HubSpot, etc.
And I've done a whole video, by the way, all about Claude MCP connections, which I'll link to right up here.
And the other option with Connector is if you don't see a tool here that's already pre-done or in the desktop extensions,
you can go down here to Add Custom Connector and you can find the MCP server URL wherever you're looking for MCPs.
And you can name it and then put it right in here.
You've got a couple of authorization advanced settings here that you can click Add and then you're connected to that tool.
So it's starting officially on September 28, 2025.
Anthropic will be using our data and conversations and chats just like OpenAI does with ChatGBT and Gemini and Grock and all that stuff.
Anthropic, which is sort of like the last of the holdouts, if you will, they are now going to be using our data,
our chats, to train the Anthropic Claude model.
So if you want to turn that off, you've got to go to Privacy because it is defaulted to On.
You'll see where it says Help Improve Claude and you want to make sure that it is turned off.
This is something that they've just kind of put out there semi-quietly.
And again, it's defaulted to On.
So if you want to turn that off, go into Settings, Privacy, Toggle Off, Help Improve Claude.
Okay, now I want to show you some use cases that are really using a lot of the powerful things that Claude has.
Like I've been talking about here.
Number one is we're going to use the Claude desktop app.
I like it the best.
I think it's the most powerful personally simply because I can connect to tools and files on my computer,
which I'm going to show you here in this first use case.
So I'm in projects and I've created a project called the, basically, the Business Brain Content Advisor.
I've trained it on all the knowledge about my business, my brand, my writing style, my tone, my brand strategy, etc., etc., etc.
So the first thing you're going to want to do is you're going to want to create a folder of some sort on your computer.
I put it in my documents and I call it the A by Playbook content.
So I click on that.
You're going to see a whole bunch of different files in here and I have system prompts.
I have memory.
I have a whole bunch of just contextual files in markdown format about my business,
about my membership, about the YouTube channel here, etc.
And then once you've set those files up on your computer and you know exactly where they are,
the instructions are now really, really important.
Okay.
So this is the essentially the prompt.
So you're my trusted advisor and expert online B2B marketer.
Tell a little bit about my business.
And so this is where I'm telling it how I want it to use the files.
Now, in addition to the files, the other thing that makes this project so powerful,
again, using Claude's connectors is I want in my project, persistent memory.
So right now Claude doesn't have memory built into it unless you're on the enterprise or teams level.
The knowledge graph memory server is an MCP.
I'll link to it in the description below.
It's not my MCP, but it's over on GitHub.
So you just scroll down here and you can see usage with Claude desktop and it gives you some different options to add this to your Claude desktop.
So how I've done it is if you go over to Claude and click on settings again, go down to developer and you click on edit config.
Is you're going to have a JSON file right here.
So you would just double click this open up as a simple text file and then you would add the word or code go.
So I'm using the NPX.
So you just simply copy this, this code right here.
And by the way, I am not a technical person.
I don't know how to code.
I'm just following instructions here.
It's actually really, really easy.
So you go to here, double click, add that code to the text file, save it and you're good to go.
Now you're connected.
Now I have the persistent memory connected to my Claude project.
Now let's go back to the Claude project and the goal behind the business brain content advisor.
Now that I have those files, we need to make sure that we can connect to those files and to the memory.
And we're going to do that within our instructions here.
So you can see here, I have you're my trusted advisor and online, an expert online B2B marketer.
My business is online only blah, blah, blah.
So now I'm saying use the file system MCP to access directories and files again.
So that was just to show you again, if I go back over to settings real quick, go down to connectors.
If I go to browse connectors desktop extensions, so it is the file system right here.
This gives Claude access to the files that are on your computer.
And the next part here, I have access and update memory files and then I have the path of where my memory is to maintain conversation continuity and track business evolution across sessions.
So again, this is where I'm adding memory to the project.
Claude currently does not have at the $20 a month plan, but I'm giving it to Claude by using the MCP that I showed you.
I tell it to use my terminology again, that's all in the files and pages that I added to the directory.
I'm telling it you can use any content from this directory.
It's subdirectoring its files, follow the memory system guidelines.
So I've given it, you know, it's like a couple hundred lines of code essentially that answer questions all about me.
So I asked Claude and by the way, this is actually a really, really good thing to show you.
So if you scroll down here, it gives you a system prompt.
So you can just say, take this right here, put it into Claude and then ask it what information, if anything, it has on you that answers these questions.
And if it doesn't have any information about you on these questions here, ask it to give you each of these questions one by one.
It's going to take you a little time to complete it.
But once you do, you've, you're basically training this project on all the information about you and your business.
It is going to save you so much.
It's going to be so much better for you going forward.
And then I give it just some more instructions on how to answer me.
Like down here, I give it tone and personality, language choices, avoid flattering.
Then I give it some principles and frameworks to use like the 80-20 rule or keep it simple, stupid, solid encapsulation principles, et cetera, et cetera.
So now I've created this amazing brain, if you will, about my business that is trained on everything about what we do in the business.
So I can ask it any kind of question.
So I can say something like, how do I grow my email list over the next 90 days?
And because it knows already what my goals are, what I'm currently doing, et cetera, it's going to give me a very specific and catered answer to my specific scenario.
Okay.
So now it is accessing my file system and getting context for my questions.
We can personalize the answers to me.
So I just click on allow once and it's going to go through and reading the different files that it needs in order to best answer my question.
Okay.
And after like 15 seconds, now it's giving me a very specific and personalized plan.
So it's looking at my newsletter, open rate, engagement rate, et cetera.
And now it's breaking down a phased plan step by step over the next 90 days.
Again, I love this because it is specifically catered to me and the up-to-date information that it has about me that are sitting on my hard drive and not out in the cloud somewhere.
And this, I just, I use this every single day.
Okay.
For this next use case, we're going to create and leverage connectors again here in cloud to create a project that is an expert executive assistant that, and I also wanted to understand really thoroughly ADHD.
So struggles with ADHD.
So I want an ADHD empathetic assistant that I can go to and help plan my week.
I can have it break down tasks for me and projects for me.
And so again, I'm going to go into cloud projects here.
I've called it my PA or personal assistant.
I think I've called it Kayla as well.
And so as you can see here, what I've done is I've connected it to Google drive, Gmail and calendar.
I also have it connected to Zapier and to Notion.
Also, again, it's connected to my file systems on the computer if I need it to access anything there.
Now for the instructions, really, really clear here.
So I've given it a core identity, given a personality and communication style.
I've made it British adaptability, primary expertise areas, etc.
Like I have it break down projects again, ADHD optimized, given it examples, etc.
So I could say, please check my calendar and suggest to me three days in time blocks
where I can tackle a huge project I have for this week.
I need to create a presentation for upcoming talk that I'm giving at a conference.
I mean, it's actually really true.
So let's go ahead and click go and see what it says.
Okay.
So it's just checked my Google calendar.
It's saying, look, I've got your main calendar and the family calendar.
Let's check what you've got this week so you can find some deep work time.
Okay.
So now that it's gotten a holistic view of my availability this week and the calendar.
Now it's saying here are three prime opportunities and the reason that it's
suggesting these times is because I've told it when I am most on the ball.
If you will, I call it them.
I call it my magic time.
So it's suggesting morning blocks for to tackle this big project and it's
breaking down my calendar and it's telling me why it's suggesting that time
and then also how to approach it.
Then it gives me a few ADHD friendly tweaks like build in transition time,
have a backup plan, etc.
So now it's asking me, well, which option do I want to choose?
So let's just say I choose the second option and now it's breaking down that
time block specifically on how it recommends.
Again, taking into account ADHD tendencies and the struggles that tend to come
with it, I can have Claude added specifically to my calendar right from here.
And again, I haven't moved from Claude here and it's helping me break down
the entire thing is checking my calendar suggesting when it's best to work on this.
Again, I use this every single day for use case number three really using a lot
of these features that make Claude really unique to use.
Again, we're going to go back to the projects aspect and feature of Claude.
And again, we're going to use the connectors.
But this time I want it specifically to be a growth advisor for the AI playbook,
which is again, is my membership community.
So again, I've added files to that folder on the hard drive that I showed you before.
And then just like other projects, the instructions that I've given it are really,
really key.
So basically I've given it a role, I've given it the core responsibilities.
I've told it what file system and memory integration that I wanted to have access
to just like we did in the first use case.
So now I have a very specific Claude project that is trained specifically on
my membership that has access to files that is not only updating,
but also relevant to the membership.
So let's type in here.
So just five ways to lower churn from 5% to 3%.
Churns at about 5% right now.
So again, it's requesting to access the files and folders on the hard drive just like before.
And after about 20 seconds, it has access all the necessary files on my hard drive
in that folder and says basically available data.
So now it's giving me a data backed churn reduction strategy.
So one, two, three, four.
I think it's five.
I asked for five.
Trade off some risks assessment.
And again, I love this because it's data backed.
It's based on the context that I have given it specifically.
And because I have the memory MCP, it will remember this information as I go through.
So let's just say, all right, I say, okay, I'm going to focus on number three.
I can tell it that it will remember that for next time, which makes it really,
really powerful.
And again, leveraging some of the capabilities that not a lot of people
know that you can do right here within Claude.
For use case number four, we are going to leverage the artifacts feature.
And we're going to create a hosted lead magnet app that is connected to my notion
and we'll put it into a notion database.
We're going to do this in about three minutes.
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to start a new chat.
I'm going to say, let's build an app.
Okay.
So now it asked me a few questions and I'm telling it that I want to build a
quiz slash survey.
Okay, cool.
Now it's giving me some suggestions on what the quiz slash survey could be about.
Maybe some angles and so forth.
So now I want to be really specific with what I want this quiz to be about.
So I'm going to say create a seven question lead magnet quiz called what's
your offer bottleneck with four results types and tailored recommendations to
those result types, add the email capture form, then show the results.
So as you can see here, this window that opened up here, this is the artifacts
version of Claude.
And so it's literally coding this quiz right before our eyes.
And so while it's doing that, what I want to do here is I want to create a simple
notion database.
You can do this with air table if you want, or even a Google sheet.
But since we use notion in, in my business, I want to have five different
columns here.
And so I want it to be the person's name, the email, the quiz answers that they
chose the result of the quiz.
And then when did they do the quiz?
So the created time and what we're going to do when this is done here, when we
tell it to map to my notion database, we're going to give it these specific
names.
Okay, so in about three minutes, it's completely coated this lead magnet,
basically an app.
And I'm laughing because I think it's so cool that it does it so fast.
And it built in the features, the seven targeted questions, result types,
scoring algorithm, email capture form, it programmed all of that on its own.
I would have no idea how to program that.
And now remember, I want the responses kicked over to a notion database.
So I'm telling it on submit, log responses to my notion database called lead
magnet quiz with these fields, name, participant email, quiz answers, result,
created time.
Essentially, it is just mirroring the column headers here.
So I'm going to click on go and it'll start to map over to notion.
It says, I'll integrate your quiz with notion automatically to capture all the
lead data.
This will give you a powerful database track conversion patterns and follow
up strategically.
So now it's adding the code in order to do that to the code that already
created for this lead magnet here.
And then it gives you the instructions to complete the integration.
So basically, you'll need to create a simple backend endpoint that receives
this data and writes the notion using their API, or you can use a webhook in
Zapier.
But before I do that, all I want to do is test the integration to notion.
So you can see here, it's asking to access notion, which is a good thing.
All right.
And the test was complete.
So it's telling me that the integration test results confirmed, et cetera.
Let's go over to notion and check.
And here it is.
So if I click on this, open it up, gives me the email address, the
quiz answers, and then also the result for that person.
Really cool.
And then we're going to leave this use case here, but just to finish it out.
So it's like 95% done.
You'd want to set up the easiest thing to do would just set up a webhook over
in Zapier.
And if you're like, I have no idea how to do that.
Just answer.
Want me to help set up Zapier webhook to make this fully automated?
Just say yes, and it will help you do that.
Walk through step by step.
If you use case number five, we're going to create a Google drive researcher.
So I'm still using the desktop version.
You can totally use the web version for this if you want to.
But what I want to do is I want to make sure that I've connected Google drive
to my to Claude.
Also, I haven't connected actually in two different ways.
Zapier and the drive search.
Now this is read only with the Zapier connection.
You can read and write to Google drive.
So essentially what I'm telling it, I wanted to look for a specific document
in Google drive.
So find my onboarding transcripts to team and drive.
So it's a Google doc.
And then I tell it to extract five practical recommendations for our next
two weeks and generate a one page brief in Google docs with title,
insights, action plan and owners.
So I'm going to click go.
And again, what it should do here is should ask me for ask me for permission
to access Google drive.
So you can see right here, it's searching Google drive for the relevant files.
Okay.
So it's found the file and it says based on the transcripts, I'll extract five
practical recommendations and it is creating a new file in my Google drive
based on these recommendations.
Okay.
And here it says perfect.
I've successfully created a comprehensive one page brief in Google docs.
This is what it's created.
So let's go take a look at Google docs and here it is created.
I just looked at my recent folder in Google drive and key insights for member
onboarding sessions, overwhelm, YouTube, et cetera, et cetera.
And then breaks it down into an action plan.
And so cool.
That's awesome.
So now final step in this use case, what I want to do is I want it to
connect to notion and put these tasks over into notion so that we can assign
people on my team to do these things.
And here's an example of one of those action items that it just, that it
just gave me and created implement, gives me the objectives, deliverables,
actions.
I love this.
So now I could just assign to somebody on my team and it did this for each
of the five things.
Again, all from within clot because I'm using the Google drive connector
for drive search.
So that is read only.
So it's looking for the file and then I have it connected to the Zapier connector
because now I can access all of the thousands of tools that Zapier has access
to.
So not only can I read on my Google drive, but now I can write to it, which
is exactly what we just did.
And I also have it connected to notion, which is why it was able to break
that plan down and assign it over in notion.
So as you can see here, there's a lot more than meets the eye when it
comes to Claude and to be completely honest with you, I am just scratching
the surface of the capabilities with Claude.
And unfortunately, as I mentioned at the top of this video, that's what
this whole thing's about.
99% of people don't know that you can even do these types of things and see
and leverage the power of Claude for your business.
So hope you got a lot out of this video here today.
Whatever link I talked about in the video here, I'll link it up in
the description below.
