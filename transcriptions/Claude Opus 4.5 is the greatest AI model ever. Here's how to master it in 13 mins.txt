I'm just going to get it out of the way.
Claude Opus 4.5 is the greatest AI model I've ever used.
It is absolutely revolutionary for coding while also being significantly
faster and cheaper.
What anthropic release today, I think is the biggest leap in AI we've seen
in maybe years.
In this video, I'll cover why I feel this way, tell you everything you need to
know about this model and how it works, show you all the tests I ran and give
you some ideas for things you can build today, even if you've never coded a day
in your life. This might sound like a whole lot of hype, but I'm about to back
up everything I just said.
If you watch this video until the end, you will be a master of Claude Opus 4.5
and be able to build the apps of your dreams.
Let's get into it.
So real quick, getting into everything that changed with Claude Opus 4.5.
We will speed through this number one when it comes to coding.
And this is not a lie.
A lot of these benchmarks, these AI companies put out are totally crap.
They totally make things up.
They overfit their models for the benchmarks.
This is true.
Opus 4.5 is significantly better than any other AI model I've ever used
when it comes to coding and it is not remotely close.
It's incredible for a gent to coding, coding in the terminal for using
different tools while it's coding for novel problem solving for solving
big bugs and issues.
It is the best and is not even really questionable that it's the best.
There's some things it's not best at and shout out Anthropic for showing
the benchmarks that it did not win at things like graduate level
reasoning, visual reasoning, multilingual Q&A.
Those are things that Gemini 3 Pro, I feel like is their sweet spot.
Anthropic sweet spots more on the building and coding side.
But for that building and coding, it is the creme de la creme unquestionably.
In fact, it is so good at coding, it beat all the other engineering
candidates that applied for Anthropic.
They gave the coding exam.
They give engineering candidates to Claude Opus 4.5.
It beat every single engineering candidate that applied for Anthropic.
Every single one.
And I'll tell you this, the coding tests they give to people applying to these
big AI research labs, they're probably the hardest tests you're ever going to get.
Opus 4.5 beat all of them higher than any human candidate ever.
I don't want to call Claude Opus 4.5 AGI.
I think we're still a bit off from that.
But I will go as far to say that this might be coding AGI.
AGI is when AI is just as good, if not better than humans in every way.
I think this is just as good, if not better than humans when it comes to coding.
I am going to say it's coding AGI and I'm going to show you why in a second.
Here's maybe the most underrated update of them all, though.
On top of all that, your conversations no longer hit walls.
Usually when you're talking to an AI and you're having longer conversations,
eventually you hit a wall and you have to like start a new chat because the
context window was filled up.
They figured out a new way inside of Claude where you're no longer hitting
walls and your conversations can basically be infinite length.
They found a new way to progressively compact as you go.
That is massive.
Now you can have massive, huge conversations in Claude, in Claude code that
don't degrade over time.
That is revolutionary and is going to make using AI so much better.
On top of that, they released Claude code desktop and this is so sick too.
Inside the Claude desktop app, which is out on Mac and Windows, you now have
this new button right here, which switches you to the coding section where
you now can use Claude code right on your desktop.
It does it both locally and on the web.
So you have your web agents that you can spin up on the side, as well as
working locally on your computer.
I've been testing this app all day and it is excellent.
It is the new way I'm going to use Claude code.
I'm not going to use visual studio code anymore.
I'm not going to be using cursor with the CLI in it or just the CLI by itself.
I think this is the best version of Claude code yet.
It's basically a wrapper for the CLI where it's taking everything going on
in your CLI and giving it a nice visual interface, right?
So it's not adding a ton on top of it.
It's just taking everything you have in your CLI and making it nice to
read, easy to use, good formatting, everything like that.
And what makes it so good now is I now have it side by side with all my
other Claude code sessions.
So instead of having to have 20 different visual studio code windows open
and all the time that slows my MacBook down to a crawl.
I now can have all my sessions side by side inside Claude code for desktop.
If I want to spin up AI agents on the cloud, I can do that.
Or if I want to work locally, I can do that.
That is so, so nice.
And on top of that, it is right next to my chats.
So I can go in, have chats with Claude, just kind of as an AI chat bot,
my co-pilot CEO and quickly switch over to Claude code with one click and spin
up agents to get work done for me.
Amazing.
But let's talk about the coding performance, the reason why we're here today.
How good is it at coding?
Well, as I said earlier, this is revolutionary.
Claude opus four, five is significantly better.
And when I say better, I'm comparing it to sonnet four, five, which I think was
the previous king of coding, but as well as Gemini three and five point one
codex, it is significantly cheaper.
That's in comparison to the previous opus.
So the previous opus was actually three times more expensive.
Four dot one was three times more expensive to four, five.
In fact, it is now the same cost inside Claude code as sonnet.
You have the same limits inside Claude code with opus four, five.
As you do sonnet four, five.
In fact, opus four, five is now the default inside Claude code.
This is the first time ever anthropics done that.
They push opus four, five on you to use instead of sonnet.
That is mind blowing.
And then on top of that, it's significantly faster.
Check this out.
One of the first tests I do with every new coding model is have it build a
3d complex first person shooter.
I gave it my prompt to build it.
It built a to do list out, which is standard.
Every model does this.
What it did is first I was very impressed.
It pulled in the right skills to use with, with the prompt right away, which
honestly, before this Claude was like 20% hit rate on pulling in the correct
skills.
Now it's at 100% and then it went in, wrote all the code and then checked
off every to do list, right?
Instead of going down the to do list one by one, it just one shot the entire
to do list.
It did this at a speed that was significantly faster than sonnet and
definitely way fast in the last opus opus was slow as F 4.1.
It was unbelievably slow.
This is not only faster than opus.
It is just as fast, if not faster than sonnet.
It completed the entire to do list.
Now, usually when you're working with an AI model, you have better, cheaper,
faster.
It's picked two of three.
Every other AI model in the past is picked two or three.
You can have it where it's better and cheaper, but it's not going to be faster.
You can have faster and better, but it's not going to be cheap.
This is the first model where it codes better, cheaper and faster.
This app I'm about to show you was completely one shot.
This is the exact conversation I had right here.
And here is the code it produced by me saying build a 3D first person shooter
with enemies and power ups.
I have ran this test with every AI model that's came out and none of them have
come remotely close to what you're about to see here.
So you come in, it immediately has different waves.
You have these spectacular visuals with stars and planets around you.
There's audio.
I think you can hear the audio through the recording of the enemies coming at you.
Really nice particle effects.
And they have different.
If you can see on the right, you're gaining XP for every single thing you kill
and you even get combos.
So if I killed things faster, you can see the combos on the right.
This was all with just a really simple prompt that said build a
stylistic first person shooter with enemies and guns and power ups.
This is by far the look, you can see the waves and the scores coming in.
This is by far the best test I've ever ran with an AI spectacular.
I had to build an entire 3d city fly through simulator.
So we have this entire city, it generated in one single file of this 3d fly
through where you can see all the buildings.
You can see the different lighting.
You can see different windows lit up.
You can see different details like the antennas on top of the building.
I've ran this with every single model.
None of them have come close to this.
Some of them have crashed my computer.
They were so bad.
This is excellent.
This is so much better than any other model has ever done.
And that was all with one shot as well.
It is writing more code faster and with higher quality that works on the first try.
It hasn't introduced any bugs in any of the tests I've done so far.
It just all works in one shot, which is amazing.
As for chatting with opus four, five, it is very strong as well.
It's very different.
It's different than what I was expecting.
So just for comparison's sake, I was planning this app with 5.1 thinking,
which was my previous favorite when it came to creative planning.
And it gives you a lot.
It's very good ideas, but, you know, you get a lot of fluff where you get a lot
of wind up on the explanation.
And then it gave me a bunch of ideas for the apps.
Every idea came with a whole bunch of bullet points and it gave me like 17
different ideas with a ton of bullet points and then even more kind of fluff
afterwards explaining it.
It's good fluff.
I like the fluff, but there's just a lot.
This is a very long explanation.
I'm just saying, Hey, can you help me plan out this app with Claude opus four,
five?
It's a little different where there's basically zero fluff, basically a
sentence wind up before the explanation.
Then it gives me a few ideas.
Every idea basically just has a one sentence explanation behind it.
And then the ending is just another one sentence.
So there's no formatting.
There's no bullet points.
Just here's your ideas and an explanation behind each.
While GBT 5.1 thinking gave me a tremendous amount of bullet points and
formatting from a speed perspective.
This was also significantly faster than 5.1 and definitely much faster than
opus 4.1.
Now the question becomes, you know, what is your preference when you ask a
question and want an explanation, do you want a ton of formatting and detail?
If you do, I'm probably still sticking with 5.1 thinking, but if you just want
quick, concise answers that gets straight to the point, opus four, five looks
like it's going to be the way to go for this.
I'm going to be honest, me personally, I think I actually do.
I like the detail.
I think I like super deep dives when I ask questions.
So I might be sticking with 5.1, but I still might be using opus four or five
more to be honest with you, because this user interface of switching between
coding and chatting is so nice and well done and simple where I can go in, give
a prompt to an AI, then come out and do a chat and go back and forth.
I might be switching to four or five.
So here's your workflow.
Here's what I would do right now to build amazing things with opus four or five.
I would make sure you update your desktop app.
I would come into the chat session, start a new chat, go to opus four or five.
I would make a list of all your interests.
Just brain dump all your interests.
Say, Hey, can you help me come up with four to five ideas for
apps I can build that are part of my interests?
Take one of those ideas that opus gives you, cause it is a really good creative
planner, switch to the code mode right here, spin up a new agent to do that work,
build it out, and then go back and forth between the chat and the agent.
Say, Hey, I just started building this out with the agent.
What would you add?
Then you take those ideas, go to the coder, put those new ideas in, go back to
your chat, say, okay, this is where we are.
This is our progress.
What are some marketing ideas?
What are some other things we can build out?
Then go back to the coder, make the chat your co-pilot CEO that plans the app out
and then make this code button your senior developer that will build the app out
for you.
I think this is the first time I can comfortably say an AI agent is a senior
developer, not a junior developer, not an intern, but actually a senior level
developer.
That's how impressed I am with opus four or five.
That's the workflow I'd use right now.
There are certain times in technology where things just get kicked up a notch
where we see progress we haven't seen before and you need to jump in early in
order to take advantage of that progress.
I think now is one of those times where the people who get in early on this
massive progress are going to have a leg up on other people.
Opus four or five is only available on the max plans for Claude code.
So you need to be paying the hundred dollars a month, but I think it is
honestly worth much more than that, to be quite honest with you.
But I think the hundred dollar month is a good place to start for testing this
out, see if it's for you.
And if you're curious, here are my new use cases when it comes to AI models,
coding opus four or five easily straight up answers to questions.
I like Gemini three current events, Gemini three creative writing.
I'm going to stick with 5.1 thinking because it's a little bit more verbose,
but business planning because it's concise.
I like opus four or five Google for video and image generation.
And it is not remotely close.
Feel free to pause if you want, but opus four or five is mind blowing.
